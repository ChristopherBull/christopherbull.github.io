If you are looking to request a reference letter from me (also known as a Letter of Recommendation), please read this page to understand if I can write a reference for you and what I require from you to be able to write a good reference letter.

## Eligibility

I write reference letters for anyone I work or collaborate with.

Students may also request a letter, though it is expected that a request is coming [from someone who has some substantive interactions with me](#undergraduate-and-masters-students). I do not write reference letters for everyone that requests one, because I receive a lot of reference requests.

### ✔ Employees and Collaborators

Yes -- please [send me a request](#request-a-letter-of-recommendation).

### ✔ Post-Graduate Research Students

Yes -- If you are a PhD student I have supervised, for example, or had some form of substantial interaction, please [send me a request](#request-a-letter-of-recommendation).

### ？Undergraduate and Masters Students

Potentially -- I do not automatically write reference letters for students. Here are some examples of when I feel it is appropriate to write a letter of recommendation for you:

- I was your project supervisor.
- I supported you outside of teaching.
- I was your tutor and I supported you in a specific way.
- You have some other form of substantial interaction with me.

If you feel these are relevant to you, please [send me a request](#request-a-letter-of-recommendation).

If we have not had substantial interactions, for example, you were a student on a module with a large cohort (and unlikely we had substantial interactions), then I will not be able to write a fair letter of recommendation. However, you can consider requesting a letter from other people, such as:

- Project supervisors
- Tutors
- Other module leaders

## Request a Letter of Recommendation

Please [consider these requirements](#requirements) below and then [contact me](/profile/).

### Requirements

For me to be able to write a good reference letter, please send me the following in your reference request:

1. **Contact details** -- What information do you need from me, such as specific contact information, job title, etc.
2. **The job advert** -- including additional documents such as the person specification.
3. **Deadline** -- When you need the reference by (if known). If I am unable to commit to meeting that deadline, I can let you know early so you have time to find other people.
4. **Suggestions for content** -- A brief bullet list of suggestions you think I could include or refer to. For example, what you think you excelled at, or other aspects you think would be good to emphasise.
5. _[Students]_ **A reminder of our interactions** -- This is especially important if you are part of a large cohort of students. Please remind me, for example, of where we have talked or how I have helped you.

I will of course write a letter that I believe to be true and fair, from my perspective, but the above will greatly assist me in writing your letter promptly.
