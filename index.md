## <span style="margin-left:.5em;">Research</span>

I am interested in the sensing, understanding, and actioning of digital health data to radically transform how people live their lives. My research interests lie in designing, developing, and evaluating secure health informatics and cybernetics platforms and ecosystem elements as a digital health infrastructure&mdash;crossing software engineering and pervasive technologies. This includes digital phenotyping, assistive and diagnostic healthcare technologies, and systems for healthcare professionals. I use co-design/creation methods to create solutions applicable to patients, service users, and health professionals. I have an interest in ethical challenges of healthcare technologies and applying mixed methods to complex problems.

## <span style="margin-left:.5em;">Teaching</span>

I am committed to high-quality teaching and promote studio education, or Studio-Based Learning (SBL), a teaching method I [researched and helped to successfully implement](http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/studios-in-software-engineering-education(a6a4d34e-cb6e-4eba-b558-03a8a10d2831).html) throughout Software Engineering at Lancaster University. Studio-Based Learning is a hands-on project- and problem-based teaching method which revolves around coaching students, inspired by architecture/design/art studios. It particularly encourages reflective practice, peer-learning, intra- and inter-group collaboration, multi-discipline teams, and teaches numerous skills for future Software Engineering leaders. Studio education is a strong approach for multi-disciplinary teams and thinking broadly about problems. I have been awarded a Best Paper award in this area ([CSEE&T 2014](https://conferences.computer.org/cseet/)) and continue to engage in both an educational and research perspective (Distinguished Reviewer Award, CSEE&T 2020).

I have experience teaching on a variety of undergraduate modules and have provided supervisory/mentorship roles to several students.
