## Lancaster University

I am an LGBTQIA+ Ally and member of 'Safe Home Base', Lancaster University's LGBTQIA+ Ally Network. As an Ally, I support and champion LGBTQIA+ people and I believe they should enjoy full equality. I aim to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in our workplace and I am available to listen to and support LGBTQIA+ students and colleagues.
