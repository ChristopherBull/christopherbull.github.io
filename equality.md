I am strongly committed to engaging with and supporting equality, diversity, and inclusivity (EDI). My core values revolve around treating others equitably, both in my professional and personal life.

I am also an LGBTQIA+ ally. As an ally, I support and champion LGBTQIA+ people and I believe they should enjoy full equality. I aim to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in any workplace and I am available to listen to and support LGBTQIA+ students and colleagues.

## Want to Discuss Equality?

I encourage my students, colleagues, and other professional peers to reach out and [contact me](profile/index.md) if they want to discuss experiences or concerns relating to equality, diversity, and inclusivity. If reporting specific issues, you can also use mechanisms provided by your organisation:

### Newcastle University

Newcastle has a range of [services available to students](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/) and is also [dedicated to improving EDI](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/who-we-are/equality/). I am the Lead for Student EDI on the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee within Newcastle University's School of Computing. In this role I am responsible for ensuring the EDI committee's remit is being considered and actioned for students.

For any matters relating to EDI, Newcastle University provides a [Report and Support](https://reportandsupport.ncl.ac.uk/) service, where you can report anonymously or speak to an advisor.

### Other Affiliations

For any other organisation I am affiliated with, you should use their own communication/reporting methods, or if you wish to speak to me specifically, you can [contact me](profile/index.md).
