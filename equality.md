I am strongly committed to engaging with and supporting equality, diversity, and inclusivity (EDI). My core values revolve around treating others equitably, both in my professional and personal life.

## Want to Discuss Equality?

I encourage my students, colleagues, and other professional peers to reach out and [contact me](profile/index.md) if they want to discuss experiences or concerns relating to equality, diversity, and inclusivity.

### Lancaster University

Lancaster has a range of [services available to students](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/student-and-education-services/) and is also [dedicated to improving EDI](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/edi/).

I am also an LGBTQIA+ Ally and member of '[Safe Home Base](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/edi/inclusive-lancaster/safe-home-base/)', Lancaster University's LGBTQIA+ Ally Network. As an Ally, I support and champion LGBTQIA+ people and I believe they should enjoy full equality. I aim to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in our workplace and I am available to listen to and support LGBTQIA+ students and colleagues.
