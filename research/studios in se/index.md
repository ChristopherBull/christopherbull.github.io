My PhD research explored the education of software engineers using a studio-based approach \[[6][Bull2013]\]. This research was grounded in transferring knowledge of design education into a software engineering context \[[6][Bull2013], [3][Bull2014a]\]. One of the main outputs of this work was the creation of the "Studio Framework" \[[1][bull2016studios], [6][Bull2013]\], which provides nine properties that reflect categories from a Grounded Theory analysis of interviews with educators from architecture, art, and design studios&mdash;prior to this, there were no shared and agreed definitions of Studio-based learning. A simple example of this tension is that some people believe it is the physical space that is important for a Studio, whilst others believe it is the activities or people that make a Studio space. At this point, you may be asking "so what"?

The framework describes many categories of how to achieve a Studio, including for Software Engineering, such as 'physical environment', 'awareness' and 'critique' of each others work, and the 'culture' of staff and students. Spaces and places that adhere to several of the studio categories will have a better chance at fostering and training students through reflective practice \[[3][Bull2014a]\], and help create future Software Engineering leaders. This research also provides examples of how to support specific categories of the framework, supported through observations \[[4][Bull2014]\]. For example, peer-testing supports explicit peer-critique and awareness of other students' code.

Ultimately, this work gave me experience of teaching and implementing a studio-based Software Engineering course at Lancaster University \[[1][bull2016studios], [2][Lee2015], [4][Bull2014], [5][Whittle2014]\]. I have been teaching, facilitating, and coaching students in SE Studios since its inception. I have also been advising fellow teaching staff about Studio education best practices.

My research into Studios has also been used internationally to inform, refine, and understand the design and implementation of other Studio-based courses at several other Universities (e.g., [University of Glasgow](https://doi.org/10.1109/CSEET.2017.23 "Experimenting with Realism in Software Engineering Team Projects: An Experience Report"), [Oulu University of Applied Sciences (Oamk)](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/education/research/eitn/journal/112/), [Monmouth University](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8424773 "Acquiring Professional Software Engineering Skills through Studio-based Learning"), [University of Technology Sydney](https://doi.org/10.1145/3286960.3286964 "What is the Effect of a Software Studio Experience on a Student’sEmployability?"), [Pennsylvania State University](https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757350 "A design studio course in application development: Lessons learned")). My Studio research has also been [used in industry to inform software critique practices](https://www.zeitspace.com/blog/were-starting-to-critique-software.-heres-why).
