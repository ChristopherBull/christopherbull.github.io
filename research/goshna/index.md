This mobile application provides accessible airport gate announcements for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. It is a lightweight design that hooks into existing airport gate infrastructure to capture spoken announcements, convert to text (with moderation, if required), then pushes notifications to the mobile application. We have coordinated with a local Deaf community charity for the engagement and co-design activities with Deaf service users.
