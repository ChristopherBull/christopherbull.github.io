Mobile Age aimed to ensure the inclusion of older adults in digital public services by developing user-friendly mobile applications based on open government data. To achieve this, Mobile Age developed a platform to allow developers to more easily create apps aimed at older adults \[[1][bull2018designing]\]. It performed a series of co-creation activities \[[2][knowles2019examining]\] to develop demonstrator apps to fulfil the needs of participants, whist demoing the functionality of the platform \[[3][Bull2017]\].

Lancaster's specific aim was to improve independent living (through reducing social isolation and loneliness)&mdash;the first demonstrator app aimed to improve social inclusion \[[4][shaw2019helping]\]. My responsibilities on the project included: design and facilitation of co-creation activities with older adults; development of an analytics Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) module for 3rd party developers to use when creating their own Mobile Age apps \[[5][mikusz2019supporting]\]; development of demonstrator apps and RESTful services; liaise and coordinate with partner institutions; and writing EU project deliverable reports.
