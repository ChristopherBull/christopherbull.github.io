![CoffeeTable example usage](/assets/images/projects/coffeetable/banner_slim.webp)

Software Engineering is a team activity, but the developers' primary tool, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is largely that of a soloist. CoffeeTable \[[1][hardy2011digitally]\] is a functional IDE prototype that exchanges the traditional IDE for one built around a shared interactive desk.

![CoffeeTable example usage](/assets/images/projects/coffeetable/CoffeeTable-tabletop.webp)

This vision of collaborative software development encourages smooth transitions between agile and traditional modes of working, easily allowing developers to switch between the shared interactive desk and their desktop/laptop spaces. This IDE aims to create a shared vision and common reference frame between the developers&mdash;key to sustaining a good design.
