IDEA-FAST aims to identify digital biomarkers that assess fatigue, sleep, and activities in daily living in neurodegenerative disorders and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. These digital endpoints are being identified for the following neurodegenerative diseases (NDD): Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and for the following immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID): Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Primary Sj√∂gren's Syndrome (PSS), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Fatigue and activities of daily living (ADL) are important for any successful therapeutic intervention. Current evaluations of ADL rely on subjective reports and questionnaires, which are prone to recall bias, reliability issues, and potentially long delays of months between reports. Through IDEA-FAST, we aim to identify these measures in an automatic and objective way.

The project is a large international undertaking, with 46 organisations across 16 countries. This includes pharmaceutical companies, academic &amp; not-for-profit institutions, small-and-medium-sized enterprises, and patient organisations.

You can keep up-to-date with the progress of this project on the [IDEA-FAST's Project Site](https://idea-fast.eu/).
