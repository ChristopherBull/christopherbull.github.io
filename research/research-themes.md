I work in human-centred computing across digital health and computing education, with a strong grounding in HCI. My research focuses on digital mental health interventions and how we teach software engineering, designing and evaluating systems that sense and respond to people in ways that are transparent, trustworthy, and grounded in real-world practice.

**At a glance:**

- Digital health platforms and measures that turn multimodal sensing into trusted, actionable endpoints
- Digital mental health and assistive technologies that are co-designed, inclusive, and behavior-aware
- Computing education and human factors: studio-inspired, AI-aware, and responsible tooling

## Digital Health Platforms and Measures (Digital Health)

- Capture and interpret multimodal signals to surface actionable health insights and digital endpoints.
- Blend sensing, understanding, and actioning to support clinicians, patients, and decision support.
- Apply trustworthy software engineering and systems approaches: requirements, privacy- and trust-aware architectures, ensure interoperability, and governance baked into platform components.

## Digital Mental Health and Assistive Technologies (HCI)

- Co-design and participatory methods for digital health services, assistive tech, and wellbeing tools.
- Accessible and inclusive solutions across mobile, ubiquitous, and immersive (AR/VR/XR) contexts.
- Mixed-method evaluation to understand user needs, adoption, and real-world impact.

## Computing Education and Human Factors of Software Engineering (Education)

- Studio-inspired approaches to teaching and studying software engineering practice.
- Responsible use of emerging tools (e.g., generative AI) to support learning, feedback, and professional workflows.
- Human factors and socio-technical analysis that keep ethics, trust, and accountability central.
