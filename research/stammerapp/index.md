StammerApp is a mobile application to support people  who  stammer, through practice exercises and information. The application idea and design emerged from user-centred design research with people who stammer, culminating in a set of design recommendations for the development of tools to support people who stammer in their everyday interactions. These recommendations were demonstrated through our StammerApp prototype.

The application was developed by Floriane Dahman, who was co-supervised by Róisín McNaney and myself. We published the workshop analysis, design recommendations, and an evaluation of the application \[[1][mcnaney2018stammerapp]\].
