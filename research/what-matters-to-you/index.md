This project focuses on improving mental health support in the North-East by shifting the focus to what truly matters to service users. Currently, mental health is often evaluated based on goals, metrics, and targets set by commissioners, not by the individuals receiving support. We believe that personal goals and unique needs should shape how we measure success in mental health care.

Working with local partners and people who have firsthand experience with mental health challenges, we will explore new, person-centred tools (approved and validated by service users) capturing each person’s own priorities. By testing these tools and gathering feedback, we aim to show how a people-powered, peer-led approach can lead to better engagement and more meaningful outcomes. The findings will also guide the development of digital tools for measuring success, potentially transforming how mental health services are designed and funded across the region.
