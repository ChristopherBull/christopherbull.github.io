GP Benchmark is a website for General Practitioners to engage and reflect on simulated medical cases to explore prevalence of certain decision-making biases \[[1][Hutchinson2020]\].

This project is part of the PhD of practising GP Wesley Hutchinson. I contribute to the design and development of various areas of this project.
