I am interested in the sensing, understanding, and actioning of digital health data to radically transform how people live their lives. My research interests lie in designing, developing, and evaluating secure health informatics and cybernetics platforms and ecosystem elements as a digital health infrastructure&mdash;crossing software engineering and pervasive technologies. This includes digital phenotyping, assistive and diagnostic healthcare technologies, and systems for healthcare professionals. I use co-design/creation methods to create solutions applicable to patients, service users, and health professionals. I have an interest in ethical challenges of healthcare technologies and applying mixed methods to complex problems.

I design, develop, and evaluate secure digital health platforms that sense, understand, and act on data in ways that improve people's lives. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering, pervasive technologies, and responsible innovation, with co-design at its core.

**Quick paths:**

- Themes: sensing/phenotyping, platform architectures, ethics and governance, human factors, education
- Projects: active and past work across digital health, behavior change, and software tooling
- Publications: selected papers plus researcher IDs
- Supervision: current, co-supervised, and past researchers

**Highlights:**

- Digital phenotyping and assistive technologies for healthcare professionals and patients
- Privacy-aware architectures and analytics for trustworthy health data use
- Studio-inspired approaches to software engineering education and human factors
