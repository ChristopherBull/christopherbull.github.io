I am interested in the sensing, understanding, and actioning of digital health data to radically transform how people live their lives. My research interests lie in designing, developing, and evaluating secure health informatics and cybernetics platforms and ecosystem elements as a digital health infrastructure&mdash;crossing software engineering and pervasive technologies. This includes digital phenotyping, assistive and diagnostic healthcare technologies, and systems for healthcare professionals. I use co-design/creation methods to create solutions applicable to patients, service users, and health professionals. I have an interest in ethical challenges of healthcare technologies and applying mixed methods to complex problems.
