# Research

I am interested in the sensing, understanding, and actioning of digital health data to radically transform how people live their lives. My research interests lie in designing, developing, and evaluating secure health informatics and cybernetics platforms and ecosystem elements as a digital health infrastructure &mdash; crossing software engineering and pervasive technologies. This includes digital phenotyping, assistive and diagnostic healthcare technologies, and systems for healthcare professionals. I use co-design/creation methods to create solutions applicable to patients, service users, and health professionals. I have an interest in ethical challenges of healthcare technologies and applying mixed methods to complex problems.

## Projects

I have worked on numerous health projects and directly contributed to research spanning several disciplines, including Systems and Software Engineering, Data Science, and Participant Engagement.

I currently work in Digital Health at Lancaster University. In this position I work on numerous Digital Health projects that are of strategic importance to Lancaster's Digital Health Centre. My main focus is the design and development of ecosystem elements, pervasive healthcare technologies, and cybernetics/informatics platforms.

| Funder | Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care System (NHS, UK) |
| Site | [www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/space/](https://www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/space/) |

SPACE is a mental health monitoring and suicide prevention platform, designed to be a Learning Health System with mobile sensing and elements of Clinical Decision Support and alerting. This project aims to enhance health professional capacity in overseeing service users and facilitate the provision of timely interventions. The core of the system is about passively monitoring the behaviours and activities of service users who are in contact with mental health services through pervasive technologies (primarily their mobile phones).

We have designed, delivered, and analysed workshops with people with lived-experience of suicide and mental health professionals, gaining further insights into working with these people in an important area.

I am one of the chief co-designers of SPACE, along with service users and other colleagues, and currently its only developer. Development has consisted of mobile sensing and reporting, pervasive systems development, analytics, ethical and privacy considerations, and a dashboard for health professionals.

### Peer-Sourcing

| Position | Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2019+) |

We have created a new technique for identifying and allocating peer interactions \[[2][honary2020what]\]. The software architecture for Peer-Sourcing was designed to enable mental health peer-support across various support-capable individuals and communities. Peer-sourcing has similarities to crowd-sourcing systems, though has several unique requirements (e.g., decentralised, low numbers of peers with heterogeneous attributes, high task urgency, and synchronous interactions). This work was an indirect output of the [SPACE project](#space-suicide-prevention-using-analytics-and-cybernetic-elements).

### Cue 2 Action

| Position | Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2019+) |
| Site | [www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/cue-2-action/](https://www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/cue-2-action/) |

An individual's behaviours and lifestyle accounts for a significant proportion of a person's health. Cue 2 Action is investigating whether systems and control theory can be used to provide a theoretical basis for persuasive health \[[6][wilson2019persuasive]\]; persuasive techniques could be dynamic based on context, persuasion effectiveness, and rule adherence. This early-stage work is exploring the theoretical underpinning and feasibility of using such a system in other health applications/systems.

### GP Benchmark

| Position | Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2019+) |

GP Benchmark is a website for General Practitioners to engage and reflect on simulated medical cases to explore prevalence of certain decision-making biases \[[1][Hutchinson2020]\].

This project is part of the PhD of practising GP Wesley Hutchinson. I contribute to the design and development of various areas of this project.

### Goshna

| Position | Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2018+) |
| Site | [www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/goshna/](https://www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/goshna/) |

This mobile application provides accessible airport gate announcements for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. It is a lightweight design that hooks into existing airport gate infrastructure to capture spoken announcements, convert to text (with moderation, if required), then pushes notifications to the mobile application. We have coordinated with a local Deaf community charity for the engagement and co-design activities with Deaf service users.

### Whyndyke Garden Village

| Position | Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2018+) |
| Site | [www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/whyndyke-garden-village](https://www.digitalhealthlancaster.xyz/whyndyke-garden-village) |

This village is an NHS Healthy new town which will utilise smart-ready homes and communities \[[4][helal2019smart]\]. Some of the village priorities include pushing telehealth, healthy communities, and creating dementia-friendly homes for lifelong living. My contributions have so far focused on exploring the digital plumbing for smart-ready, configurable, lifelong living homes. Additionally, I have supervised undergraduate projects exploring novel individual and community engagements in the context of this village.

### StammerApp

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| -------- | -------- |
| Position | Supervisor / Senior Research Associate, Digital Health – SCC, Lancaster University (2018) |

StammerApp is a mobile application to support people  who  stammer, through practice exercises and information. The application idea and design emerged from user-centred design research with people who stammer, culminating in a set of design recommendations for the development of tools to support people who stammer in their everyday interactions. These recommendations were demonstrated through our StammerApp prototype.

The application was developed by Floriane Dahman, who was co-supervised by Róisín McNaney and myself. We published the workshop analysis, design recommendations, and an evaluation of the application \[[10][mcnaney2018stammerapp]\].

### Mobile Age

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| -------- | -------- |
| Position | Senior Research Associate, Pervasive Systems – SCC, Lancaster University (2016-2018) |
| Funder | EU Horizon 2020 |
| Site | [mobile-age.eu](https://mobile-age.eu/) |

Mobile Age aimed to ensure the inclusion of older adults in digital public services by developing user-friendly mobile applications based on open government data. To achieve this, Mobile Age developed a platform to allow developers to more easily create apps aimed at older adults \[[11][bull2018designing]\]. It performed a series of co-creation activities \[[5][knowles2019examining]\] to develop demonstrator apps to fulfil the needs of participants, whist demoing the functionality of the platform \[[12][Bull2017]\]. Lancaster's specific aim was to improve independent living (through reducing social isolation and loneliness) – the first demonstrator app aimed to improve social inclusion \[[8][shaw2019helping]\]. My responsibilities on the project included: design and facilitation of co-creation activities with older adults; development of an analytics Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) module for 3rd party developers to use when creating their own Mobile Age apps \[[7][mikusz2019supporting]\]; development of demonstrator apps and RESTful services; liaise and coordinate with partner institutions; and writing EU project deliverable reports.

### SAMS

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| -------- | -------- |
| Position | Research Associate, Software Engineering – SCC, Lancaster University (2014-2016) |
| Funder | EPSRC |
| Site | [ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/sams/](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/sams/) |

The SAMS project (Software Architecture for Mental health Self-management) aimed to detect early markers of mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, through participants' computer use \[[9][Stringer2018]\]. The aim is to enable earlier treatment and better quality of life for patients. This is achieved through a variety of novel data capture techniques (for low-level mouse and keyboard interactions, as well as higher-level contextual information). This is then analysed to determine patterns of usage through data mining \[[13][Gledson2016]\] and natural language processing (NLP) \[[14][Bull2016]\], particularly Propositional Idea Density. We found that passive monitoring of computer use behaviours can indicate early cognitive impairment [in submission]. Significant work also explored the requirements engineering aspects of working in such as a sensitive context \[[3][sutcliffe2020known],[17][Sawyer2015],[18][Sutcliffe2014]\]. My main responsibilities were the design and development of the secure data capture software, the design and development of an NLP tool, coordination of development activities with Manchester University, ethical transmission and storage of participant data, project support software, and the NLP of participant data.

### Studios in Software Engineering Education

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| -------- | -------- |
| Position | PhD Student, [HighWire CDT](https://epsrc.ukri.org/research/ourportfolio/themes/digitaleconomy/activities/cdts/) / Software Engineering – SCC, Lancaster University (2010-2015) |
| Funder | EPSRC |
| Site | [highwire.lancaster.ac.uk](http://highwire.lancaster.ac.uk/) |

My PhD research explored the education of software engineers using a studio-based approach \[[22][Bull2013]\]. This research was grounded in transferring knowledge of design education into a software engineering context \[[22][Bull2013],[19][Bull2014a]\].

This PhD also gave me experience of teaching and implementing a studio-based Software Engineering course \[[15][bull2016studios],[16][Lee2015],[20][Bull2014],[21][Whittle2014]\].
