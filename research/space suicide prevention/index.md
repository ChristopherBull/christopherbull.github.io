SPACE is a mental health monitoring and suicide prevention platform, designed to be a Learning Health System with mobile sensing and elements of Clinical Decision Support and alerting. This project aims to enhance health professional capacity in overseeing service users and facilitate the provision of timely interventions. The core of the system is about passively monitoring the behaviours and activities of service users who are in contact with mental health services through pervasive technologies (primarily their mobile phones).

We have designed, delivered, and analysed workshops with people with lived-experience of suicide and mental health professionals, gaining further insights into working with these people in an important area.

I am one of the chief co-designers of SPACE, along with service users and other colleagues, and currently its only developer. Development has consisted of mobile sensing and reporting, pervasive systems development, analytics, ethical and privacy considerations, and a dashboard for health professionals.
